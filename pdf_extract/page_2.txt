 
For example, think about the query [what does love mean]. 
 
Result Block 
 
Query: [what does love mean] 
 
Rating 
 
Special Content Result Block 
 
Most users would probably not click on 
 
the Special Content Result Block, 
 
because the block contains a large 
 
amount of helpful content and has no 
 
obvious landing page link associated 
 
with it. 
 
Therefore, base your rating on the 
 
content inside the block itself. 
 
Web Search Result Block 
 
In this case, users would have to click on 
 
the web search result in order to get an 
 
answer to the question. 
 
Therefore, base your rating on the 
 
content of the landing page.
