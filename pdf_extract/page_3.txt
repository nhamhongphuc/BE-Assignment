Note: The guidance in this section specifically applies to Needs Met ratings.  For Special Content Result Blocks that have 
 
landing pages, you may or may not also be asked to provide PQ ratings.  In these cases, your PQ rating should always be 
 
based on the landing page.  Please refer to  
Section  
14.0  
for more about the relationship between Needs  
Met and Page 
 
Quality ratings.
