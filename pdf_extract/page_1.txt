 
Part 3: Needs Met Rating Guideline 
 
13.0  
Rating Using the Needs Met Scale 
 
There  
are  
many  
different  
kinds  
of  
queries  
and  
results,  
but  
the  
process  
of  
rating  
is  
the  
same:  
Needs  
Met  
rating  
tasks  
ask 
 
you to focus on user needs and think about how helpful and satisfying the result is for the users 
 
. 
 
This is what the Needs Met rating slider looks like: 
 
Rating 
 
Description 
 
Fully Meets (FullyM) 
 
A special rating category, which only applies to certain queries and results.  
All or almost all 
 
users would be immediately and fully satisfied by the result and would not need to view other 
 
results to satisfy their need. 
 
Highly Meets (HM) 
 
Very helpful for many or most users.  Some users may wish to see additional results. 
 
Moderately Meets (MM)  
Helpful for many users OR very helpful for some users.  Some or many users may wish to 
 
see additional results. 
 
Slightly Meets (SM) 
 
Helpful for fewer users.  There is a connection between the query and the result, but not a 
 
strong or satisfying connection.  Many or most users would wish to see additional results. 
 
Fails to Meet (FailsM) 
 
Completely fails to meet the needs of the users.  All or almost all users would wish to see 
 
additional results. 
 
Please  
note  
that  
you  
may  
assign  
in-between  
ratings.  
Use  
in-between  
ratings  
if  
you  
think  
the  
rating  
of  
a  
result  
falls 
 
between two labels.  You can either drag the slider or click on the point that you want the slider to land on.

Rating Result Blocks: Block Content and Landing Pages 
 
For Needs Met rating, you will assign a rating to each result.  Each result includes the content inside the result block and 
 
landing pages associated with the result.   
 
Which part of the result do you rate?  It depends on both the query and the result block: 
 
Type of Block 
 
What to Rate 
 
Special Content Result Block 
 
(SCRB) 
 
Note: Assume that interactive 
 
result blocks function as intended. 
 
Try to interact with the result block 
 
as some links, buttons, or other 
 
features in your rating task may 
 
work. 
 
The content inside this type of block should always play a large role in your rating.   
 
Some Special Content Result Blocks may have links to landing pages.  In these 
 
cases, think about whether a user would click on the link in order to satisfy their 
 
user need. 
 
● 
 
If most users would not click, rate the Special Content Result Block based 
 
on the block content alone. 
 
● 
 
If some or many users would click, you may consider the helpfulness of the 
 
landing page(s) in addition to the content in the block.  In this case,  
both 
 
need to be helpful to justify a high rating. 
 
Web Search Result Block 
 
A click is required, and you should evaluate the landing page to assign a rating.
